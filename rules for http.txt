✅ RULE 1 — Client Must Always Start the Communication

Meaning:
A server will never start talking on its own.
The client (mobile/web app) must send the first request.

Example:
Your Swiggy app sends a request:
“Show restaurant list.”
The server responds only after the app asks.

✅ RULE 2 — Every HTTP Communication Has 2 Parts

Client Request

Server Response

Example:

Request → “GET /restaurants”

Response → “Here is the list of restaurants”

Always 2 parts.

✅ RULE 3 — HTTP Follows a Fixed Request Structure

A request must contain:

Request Line → GET /products

Headers → Content-Type, Authorization

Body → JSON data (only for POST/PUT)

Example:
When you login to Amazon:

POST /login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "jinu@gmail.com",
  "password": "123456"
}

✅ RULE 4 — The Server Must Send a Status Code in Every Response

Examples:

200 OK

404 Not Found

500 Server Error

401 Unauthorized

Example:
You enter wrong password on Instagram → Server sends 401 Unauthorized.

✅ RULE 5 — HTTP Uses Standard Methods

Common methods:

GET

POST

PUT

DELETE
etc.

Example:
Ola app:

GET → Fetch nearby cabs

POST → Book a cab

DELETE → Cancel a ride

✅ RULE 6 — URLs Must Identify What You Want

The URL should clearly tell the server what resource you need.

Example:
Amazon product:

/products/12345


This clearly identifies product with ID 12345.

✅ RULE 7 — HTTP Is Stateless

Each request is treated independently.
Server does not remember previous requests.

Example:
When you browse Flipkart, each page request is separate.
Flipkart doesn’t know who you are unless you send the session token each time.

✅ RULE 8 — Everything Must Be in Text Format

Headers, status codes, methods, URLs → all are text.

Example:

GET /cart
Host: flipkart.com


All text. Easy to debug and readable.

✅ RULE 9 — The Client Must Specify Data Type

Client must say what type of data it is sending.

Example:
Swiggy login:

Content-Type: application/json


It tells the server:
“Data is in JSON format.”

✅ RULE 10 — HTTP Response Must Follow Structure

A response must contain:

Status Line → 200 OK

Headers → Content-Type

Body → Data

Example:

200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "restaurants": [...]
}

✅ RULE 11 — Use of HTTP Versions

Common versions:

HTTP/1.1

HTTP/2

HTTP/3

Example:
When you stream YouTube videos, modern browsers use HTTP/3 for faster delivery.

✅ RULE 12 — Communication Must Follow ASCII Text Encoding

All HTTP messages (headers, status lines) follow ASCII encoding (English readable characters).

Example:
Even if you request:

/movie/தலபதி


Internally it is converted to ASCII-safe encoded text.

✅ RULE 13 — HTTP Can Work Over Any Media Layer

HTTP can run over:

WiFi

Mobile data

Broadband

Satellite internet

LAN
Any medium that carries packets.

Example:
You can browse Amazon on:

WiFi at home

Mobile hotspot

Office network
HTTP works everywhere.

✅ RULE 14 — HTTP Does Not Care About the Device

HTTP does not care if you are using:

Mobile

Laptop

Smart TV

Tablet

Car infotainment system

Example:
Amazon.com works the same:

On Android

On iPhone

On laptop

On Smart TV browser

Same rules, same request, same response.
