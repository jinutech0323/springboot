What is Normalization? (In simple words)

Normalization = Organizing data properly to avoid problems

Problems it solves:
Duplicate data 
Data inconsistency 
Update problems 
Confusion 

Real-Life Situation (Before Normalization)
Imagine a college system where you store everything in ONE table.
| student_id | student_name | course_name | course_fee | address        |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| 1          | Ravi         | Java        | 30000      | Chennai, TN    |
| 2          | Ravi         | Python      | 25000      | Chennai, TN    |
| 3          | Anu          | Java        | 30000      | Coimbatore, TN |

Problems here:
Ravi’s name & address repeated
Java course fee repeated multiple times
If Java fee changes → update many rows ❌
If Ravi changes address → update many rows ❌
This table is UNNORMALIZED
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First Normal Form (1NF)
Rule of 1NF:

✔ No multiple values in one column
✔ Each column contains atomic (single) value
1NF Table
Fix:
Address should not be mixed like Chennai, TN

| student_id | student_name | course_name | course_fee | city       | state |
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1          | Ravi         | Java        | 30000      | Chennai    | TN    |
| 2          | Ravi         | Python      | 25000      | Chennai    | TN    |
| 3          | Anu          | Java        | 30000      | Coimbatore | TN    |

Now:
Each column has single value
Still duplicates exist → move to 2NF

=======================================================================================
Rule of 2NF:

✔ Must be in 1NF
✔ No partial dependency

What is partial dependency?
Non-key column depends on only part of primary key
assume
Primary key = (student_id, course_name)

Problem:
student_name, city, state depend only on student_id
course_fee depends only on course_name

So we split tables.
student table

| student_id | student_name | city       | state |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----- |
| 1          | Ravi         | Chennai    | TN    |
| 3          | Anu          | Coimbatore | TN    |

course table
| course_id | course_name | course_fee |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 101       | Java        | 30000      |
| 102       | Python      | 25000      |

enrollment table(connection)
| student_id | course_id |
| ---------- | --------- |
| 1          | 101       |
| 1          | 102       |
| 3          | 101       |

Now:

Student data stored once
Course data stored once
Relationship maintained properly
Still one issue → move to 3NF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Third Normal Form (3NF)
Rule of 3NF:

✔ Must be in 2NF
✔ No transitive dependency

Transitive dependency means:
A column depends on another non-key column

Problem:
city → state
State depends on city, not directly on student_id

Fix: Separate Address table
address table
| address_id | city       | state |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1          | Chennai    | TN    |
| 2          | Coimbatore | TN    |
updated student table
| student_id | student_name | address_id |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 1          | Ravi         | 1          |
| 3          | Anu          | 2          |

Final Normalized Design (Perfect 3NF)

✅ Student Table
✅ Course Table
✅ Address Table
✅ Enrollment Table

Benefits:

✔ No duplication
✔ Easy updates
✔ Clean structure
✔ Real-world mapping
✔ Used in real databases & Spring Boot

One-Line Memory Trick (Very Important)

1NF → Atomic values

2NF → Remove partial dependency

3NF → Remove transitive dependency
