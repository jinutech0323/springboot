$2a$10$H0db0zNQZylper3WTuwCFetgDjF9j4TBnN2XPK/ymY3/kOrhYjiEK

$2a$ → Algorithm identifier
2a means bcrypt algorithm (version 2a)
Tells the system which hashing algorithm was used
There are also variants like 2b, 2y

$10$ → Cost factor (strength)
10 means 2¹⁰ = 1024 rounds
Higher number = slower but more secure
Common values: 10–12
This makes brute-force attacks difficult

H0db0zNQZylper3WTuwCFe → Salt
Random value added to password before hashing
Prevents:
Rainbow table attacks
Same password → same hash problem
Every user gets a unique salt

tgDjF9j4TBnN2XPK/ymY3/kOrhYjiEK → Hashed password
Final encrypted result
Generated using:
bcrypt(password + salt, cost)
